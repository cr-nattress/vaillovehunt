# Documentation System: Technical Plan

This feature adds a complete, lowâ€‘maintenance documentation stack to the existing React codebase with minimal disruption. It follows the guidance in `prompts/DOCUMENTAION.md` and ships in small, reversible phases.

## Objectives
- Narrative docs (Docusaurus, MDX) with search and live React snippets.
- Component docs (Storybook) with prop tables and examples.
- API reference (TypeDoc) generated from TSDoc.
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) using MADR format.
- CI checks to keep docs honest (builds, link checking, Storybook build, TypeDoc).

## Principles
- Additive first, do not break the existing app build.
- Reuse what exists; smallest viable configuration.
- Clear scripts in `package.json`; consistent with the detected package manager.

## Phases
1) Doc Plan & Environment Detection (no changes; outputs a plan)
2) Docusaurus Setup (narrative, MDX, search)
3) Storybook Setup (component docs)
4) TypeDoc Setup (API reference)
5) ADRs & Docs Content Seeds
6) CI Guards (build docs, stories, typedoc; link checks)
7) Developer Ergonomics (scaffolds, PR template)

See each phase subfolder for tasks and validation. Track progress in `STATUS.md`.
