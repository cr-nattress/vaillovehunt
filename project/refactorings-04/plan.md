Love the direction, Chris. Here’s a pragmatic, growth-ready blueprint that hardens what you’ve got, keeps you moving fast, and avoids the “oops we built a sandcastle” problem.

# North Star

* **Separate UI state from server state.** UI state = local, ephemeral; server state = fetched/persisted. Don’t blur them.
* **Ports & Adapters (Hexagonal-ish).** Your React features shouldn’t know *how* storage works—only *that* there’s a storage port. Blob/KV/HTTP become swappable adapters.
* **Schema-first, versioned JSON.** Treat App/Org JSON as real contracts with migration paths.
* **Feature slices, not layer soup.** Each feature owns its pages, components, hooks, tests, and data access.
* **Defense in depth.** Concurrency, retries, optimistic updates, and background “best-effort” writes with audit trails.

```

**Why this helps:** features stay cohesive, adapters are swappable, and domain logic isn’t sprinkled across components.

---

## 2) State management: React Query + Zustand (or RTK)

* **React Query (TanStack Query)** for **server state**: `useQuery` for App/Org JSON, `useMutation` for writes with **optimistic updates** + **rollback**.
* **Zustand** (you already have stores) for **UI-only** state (selected team, modals, “open settings once”, reveal states). Keep it tiny and serializable.

**Rules**

* Never store server entities in Zustand. Fetch via Query; cache keys like `['org', orgId]`, `['events', date]`.
* Persist critical drafts offline (IndexDB via `idb-keyval`) for the wizard.

---

## 3) Ports & Adapters (clean seams)

Define **ports** as small TypeScript interfaces:

```ts
// ports/event.repo.port.ts
export interface EventRepoPort {
  listToday(input: { now: Date; orgId?: string }): Promise<EventSummary[]>;
  getEvent(input: { orgId: string; eventId: string }): Promise<Event>;
  upsertEvent(input: { orgId: string; event: Event }): Promise<ETagged<Event>>;
}
```

Provide **adapters**:

* `infra/http/events.http.ts` (calls `/api/events`)
* `infra/storage/blob.adapter.ts` (reads App/Org JSON)
* `infra/storage/kv.adapter.ts` (KV where needed)
* Select adapter **by feature flag** in a tiny composition point (e.g., `app/providers`).

**Outcome:** Feature code depends on interfaces, not Netlify or Cloudinary.

---

## 4) Data contracts: versioned schemas + migrations

* Keep Zod schemas in `src/lib/zod`. Export **`CURRENT_VERSION`**.
* In each JSON document (`App JSON`, `Org JSON`), include:

  ```json
  { "schemaVersion": 3, "updatedAt": "2025-09-08T12:00:00Z", "etag": "..." }
  ```
* Add **migrations** as pure functions: `migrateV2toV3(org: any): OrgV3`.
* On read: detect version → run needed migrations in memory → cache as **normalized** objects.
* On write: always write the **current** schema with new `etag`.

**Why:** you’ll ship changes without bricking old blobs.

---

## 5) Concurrency, reliability, and “best-effort” writes

* **ETag precondition writes** in adapters. If `etag` mismatch → bubble a typed `ConcurrencyError` → React Query rolls back optimistic changes and shows a “someone else edited this—refresh?” toast.
* **Exponential backoff** for blob/KV transient failures.
* **Write-behind** for non-critical uploads: enqueue with `navigator.sendBeacon` or a small **in-tab queue**; display “Syncing…” badge; keep UI snappy.
* **Audit trail**: append small JSON entries (time, actor, action) to a per-org `audit.jsonl`. It’s gold for moderation and debugging.

---

## 6) Forms & builders (wizard solidity)

* **React Hook Form + Zod resolver** for all builders.
* **Field arrays** for steps/hints with controlled components.
* **Draft autosave** to IndexedDB every N seconds; “Restore draft?” on re-open.
* **Validation tiers**:

  1. Synchronous Zod (client).
  2. Serverless validator (same Zod schema) before final persist.

---

## 7) Media pipeline (images + video)

* **Server-signed upload** only (Netlify function -> Cloudinary signature).
* Standardize folder/tag convention: `org/{orgId}/events/{eventId}/teams/{teamId}/{type}/`.
* Generate poster/thumbnail server-side via **Cloudinary transformations** (don’t trust client for permanence).
* **Pointer objects** in Org JSON store only: `{ publicId, url, width, height, kind, createdAt }`.

---

## 8) Location & maps (privacy-first)

* `geo.port.ts` with two adapters: `browserGeo` and `ipGeo`.
* Ask for precise location **just-in-time** with a clear consent modal; cache consent + coarse fallback.
* Leaflet map feature as its own slice with lazy route; keep data pulls independent from map rendering.

---

## 9) Error handling, UX resilience

* **Central error boundary** + **toaster** for recoverables.
* **Typed errors** across adapters: `NetworkError | ConcurrencyError | AuthError | ValidationError`.
* **Empty states > spinners**: mocks only for dev; in prod prefer “no events today” with CTA.

---

## 10) Security & multi-tenancy

* **Org isolation** everywhere: every storage key path and function validates `orgId` access.
* **Signed URLs** only; no secrets in client.
* **Rate-limit** sensitive endpoints; include request IDs.
* **Retention policy** honored by a **scheduled function** that purges old uploads per App JSON policy.

---

## 11) Testing strategy (fast now, safe later)

* **Unit**: pure domain (policies, mappers, migrations).
* **Integration**: repositories talk to **MSW** (mock HTTP) and **local blob emulator** (you can simulate with in-memory layer).
* **Contract tests**: Zod schema snapshots + tests ensuring serverless functions and client parsers match.
* **E2E**: Playwright happy path—join event, pick team, upload, submit.

> Rule of thumb: If a bug burned you once, turn that into a test next day. Future-you will send cookies.

---

## 12) Observability & ops

* **Structured logs** in adapters (`logger.ts`) with `eventId`, `orgId`, `requestId`—ship to Sentry (client + functions).
* **Feature flag registry** with typed accessors; allow remote flags via App JSON.
* **Preview deploy checks**: typecheck, unit tests, lint, and a minimal Playwright smoke on Netlify preview URLs.

---

## 13) Developer experience & quality gates

* **TypeScript “strict”:** true. Kill JS/JSX drift—migrate to TS/TSX.
* **ESLint + Prettier** + **import/order** + **unused-imports**.
* **Husky + lint-staged** for pre-commit.
* **Conventional Commits** + **Changesets** for versioned releases of shared packages (if you extract domain libs later).
* **Path aliases** in `tsconfig`: `@app/*`, `@features/*`, `@domain/*`, `@ports/*`, `@infra/*`.

---

## 14) API & contracts

* If `/api/events` grows, publish an **OpenAPI** (or tRPC) contract from functions → generate client types.
* Keep **DTO mappers** at the edge (`*.mappers.ts`) so your domain models stay stable while transports change.

---

## 15) Progressive web & offline (optional but nice)

* **PWA shell**: cache routes and assets; offline drafts for wizards; resume upload when online.
* **Background sync** (where supported) for media queues.

---

## 16) Roadmap by horizon

### Now (1–2 weeks)

* Introduce **ports & adapters** (Event/Org repos).
* Add **React Query** for events/org reads; keep Zustand for UI bits.
* Turn on **TS strict**, path aliases, ESLint/Husky.
* Implement **ETag writes + optimistic updates**.
* RHF + Zod in wizard; draft autosave (IndexedDB).

### Next 30 days

* Versioned **Zod schemas + migrations**; add audit.jsonl.
* Media: **signed upload** function + pointer objects.
* Leaflet MVP with consent gating.
* Contract tests with MSW; Playwright smoke.

### Next 90 days

* Scheduled retention worker; org isolation review.
* OpenAPI/tRPC contract; code-gen client.
* PWA offline for drafts and “best-effort” sync.
* Observability upgrades (SLOs on functions).

## 17) Tiny samples (patterns)

**Adapter selection by flag**

```ts
// app/providers/ports.ts
import { eventsHttp } from '@/infra/http/events.http';
import { eventsBlob } from '@/infra/storage/blob.adapter';
import { flags } from '@/config/flags';

export const eventRepo = flags.USE_HTTP ? eventsHttp() : eventsBlob();
```

**Optimistic mutation**

```ts
const qc = useQueryClient();
const mutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: (input: UpsertEventInput) => eventRepo.upsertEvent(input),
  onMutate: async (input) => {
    await qc.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ['event', input.event.id] });
    const prev = qc.getQueryData(['event', input.event.id]);
    qc.setQueryData(['event', input.event.id], input.event);
    return { prev };
  },
  onError: (_err, _input, ctx) => ctx?.prev && qc.setQueryData(['event', ctx.prev.id], ctx.prev),
  onSettled: (_data, _err, input) => qc.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['event', input.event.id] })
});
```

**Versioned schema**

```ts
export const OrgV3 = z.object({
  schemaVersion: z.literal(3),
  org: z.object({ id: z.string(), name: z.string() }),
  hunts: z.array(/* ... */),
  updatedAt: z.string(),
  etag: z.string().optional()
});

export type Org = z.infer<typeof OrgV3>;
```

## 18) Checklists

**Before merging a new feature**

* [ ] Port defined (interface)
* [ ] Adapter implemented + tests
* [ ] Zod schema updated + migration (if needed)
* [ ] UI state separated from server state
* [ ] Error types handled (concurrency, validation, network)
* [ ] a11y: labels, keyboard paths
* [ ] E2E happy path updated

**Before releasing**

* [ ] Feature flags default safe
* [ ] Sentry breadcrumbs in key flows
* [ ] Docs: ADR + readme for the feature

---

## 19) Where this leaves you

* Faster iteration (features live in their slice, not scattered).
* Safer data (migrations + ETags + audit trail).
* Swappable infra (Blob/KV/API) without refactors.
* A codebase that welcomes new features without turning brittle.

If you want, I can turn this into a repo PR checklist and a minimal scaffold (ports, adapters, providers, and one feature migrated) so you’ve got a “golden path” to copy-paste.
