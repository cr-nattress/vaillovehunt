## Current Phase
- **Phase 4 COMPLETED** ✅
- Ready to proceed with Phase 5: React Query Read-Only

## Phase 1 Completion Summary
**Completed:** 2025-09-08
- ✅ Created `src/ports/` directory with clean interface definitions:
  - `event.repo.port.ts` - EventRepoPort interface (listToday, getEvent, upsertEvent)
  - `org.repo.port.ts` - OrgRepoPort interface (getApp, getOrg, listOrgs, upsertOrg, upsertApp)  
  - `media.port.ts` - MediaPort interface (uploadImage, uploadVideo, deleteMedia)
- ✅ Created `src/infra/` directory structure with adapter stubs:
  - `infra/http/` - HTTP-based adapters (events.http.adapter.ts, orgs.http.adapter.ts)
  - `infra/storage/` - Storage adapters (blob.adapter.ts, kv.adapter.ts)
  - `infra/media/` - Media adapters (cloudinary.adapter.ts)
- ✅ Added index.ts barrel exports for discoverability
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ No runtime behavior changes - purely additive

**Next:** Phase 2 will add centralized config and feature flags to control adapter selection.

## Phase 2 Completion Summary
**Completed:** 2025-09-08
- ✅ Created `src/config/` directory with centralized configuration:
  - `config.ts` - Typed configuration from environment variables with safe defaults
  - `flags.ts` - Comprehensive feature flags with rollout documentation 
  - `index.ts` - Barrel exports with backward compatibility helpers
- ✅ Structured feature flags by category (repository, media, ui, geo, observability, experimental)
- ✅ Added detailed documentation for each flag including rollout strategy and phase mapping
- ✅ Type-safe configuration access with helper functions (`getConfig`, `getFlag`)
- ✅ Backward compatibility exports for migration from old config.ts
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ No runtime behavior changes - purely additive

**Next:** Phase 3 will add schema validation and migrations for App/Org JSON contracts.

## Phase 3 Completion Summary
**Completed:** 2025-09-08
- ✅ Added `CURRENT_APP_SCHEMA_VERSION` constant to `src/types/appData.schemas.ts`
- ✅ Added `CURRENT_ORG_SCHEMA_VERSION` constant to `src/types/orgData.schemas.ts`
- ✅ Updated schema definitions to use version constants
- ✅ Created `src/lib/migrations/` directory with typed migration utilities:
  - `appJson.migrations.ts` - App JSON migration functions with fallback defaults
  - `orgJson.migrations.ts` - Org JSON migration functions with validation helpers
  - `index.ts` - Centralized exports for all migration utilities
  - `README.md` - Usage documentation and validation examples
- ✅ Added placeholder migration functions for future version upgrades (v1.0→v1.1, v1.1→v1.2)
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ No runtime behavior changes - purely additive

**Next:** Phase 4 will implement EventService adapter with feature flag controls.

## Phase 4 Completion Summary
**Completed:** 2025-09-08
- ✅ Created `MockEventAdapter` implementing `EventRepoPort` with existing mock logic
- ✅ Created `BlobEventAdapter` implementing `EventRepoPort` using blob-backed data access
- ✅ Implemented `EventAdapterFactory` with singleton pattern for adapter selection
- ✅ Added feature flag integration using `repository.enableBlobEvents` flag
- ✅ Updated `EventService.ts` to delegate to adapters with legacy fallback
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing `OrgEvent` interface
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and console logging for debugging
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation passes and build succeeds
- ✅ No breaking changes - mocks remain default when feature flags are OFF

**Key Files Created:**
- `src/infra/http/events.mock.adapter.ts` - Mock adapter for default behavior
- `src/infra/storage/events.blob.adapter.ts` - Blob-backed read-only adapter  
- `src/infra/events.adapter.factory.ts` - Adapter selection composition point

**Next:** Phase 5 will add React Query for read-only operations and server state management.

## Notes
- Keep all changes additive until a phase explicitly switches code paths behind a feature flag.
- Each phase should be reviewable within ~30 minutes.
