# Refactorings 04: Status

This status file is updated after each phase to reflect progress and next steps.

## Phase Checklist
- [x] Phase 1: Ports & Adapters Skeleton (no behavior change) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Phase 2: Config & Feature Flags (centralized, typed) ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] Phase 3: Schemas & Migrations (App/Org JSON contracts)
- [ ] Phase 4: EventService via Adapter (flagged; mocks default)
- [ ] Phase 5: React Query Read-Only (events/org reads)
- [ ] Phase 6: Wizard Forms: RHF + Zod + Draft Autosave
- [ ] Phase 7: Blob/Registry Services Read-Only (list via blobs)
- [ ] Phase 8: ETag & Concurrency (write preconditions)
- [ ] Phase 9: Media Uploads Adapter Boundary
- [ ] Phase 10: Tests, Observability, Cleanup

## Current Phase
- **Phase 2 COMPLETED** ✅
- Ready to proceed with Phase 3: Schemas & Migrations

## Phase 1 Completion Summary
**Completed:** 2025-09-08
- ✅ Created `src/ports/` directory with clean interface definitions:
  - `event.repo.port.ts` - EventRepoPort interface (listToday, getEvent, upsertEvent)
  - `org.repo.port.ts` - OrgRepoPort interface (getApp, getOrg, listOrgs, upsertOrg, upsertApp)  
  - `media.port.ts` - MediaPort interface (uploadImage, uploadVideo, deleteMedia)
- ✅ Created `src/infra/` directory structure with adapter stubs:
  - `infra/http/` - HTTP-based adapters (events.http.adapter.ts, orgs.http.adapter.ts)
  - `infra/storage/` - Storage adapters (blob.adapter.ts, kv.adapter.ts)
  - `infra/media/` - Media adapters (cloudinary.adapter.ts)
- ✅ Added index.ts barrel exports for discoverability
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ No runtime behavior changes - purely additive

**Next:** Phase 2 will add centralized config and feature flags to control adapter selection.

## Phase 2 Completion Summary
**Completed:** 2025-09-08
- ✅ Created `src/config/` directory with centralized configuration:
  - `config.ts` - Typed configuration from environment variables with safe defaults
  - `flags.ts` - Comprehensive feature flags with rollout documentation 
  - `index.ts` - Barrel exports with backward compatibility helpers
- ✅ Structured feature flags by category (repository, media, ui, geo, observability, experimental)
- ✅ Added detailed documentation for each flag including rollout strategy and phase mapping
- ✅ Type-safe configuration access with helper functions (`getConfig`, `getFlag`)
- ✅ Backward compatibility exports for migration from old config.ts
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ No runtime behavior changes - purely additive

**Next:** Phase 3 will add schema validation and migrations for App/Org JSON contracts.

## Notes
- Keep all changes additive until a phase explicitly switches code paths behind a feature flag.
- Each phase should be reviewable within ~30 minutes.
