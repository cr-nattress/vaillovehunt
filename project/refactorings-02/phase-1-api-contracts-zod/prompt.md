# Phase 1 â€” API Contracts & Runtime Validation (Zod)

Goal
- Prevent brittle failures from changing payload shapes by validating all incoming/outgoing data at service boundaries using Zod.

Scope
- Add `zod` and define schemas for key models:
  - PhotoRecord, UploadResponse, CollageResponse, Settings, FeedItem
- Apply validation in:
  - `src/services/PhotoService.ts`
  - `src/client/PhotoUploadService.ts`
  - `src/client/DualWriteService.ts`
  - `src/features/feed/services/FeedService.ts`
- Map parse errors to a unified error type with friendly messages.

Out of Scope
- Changing transport libraries; keep existing `apiClient` for now.

Implementation Steps
- Add `zod` to dependencies.
- Create `src/types/schemas.ts` with shared zod schemas and TS types via `z.infer`.
- In each service, validate responses before returning to callers. Example for `PhotoService.getPhotosByCompanyEvent`:
  - Parse `{ photos: PhotoRecord[] }` with `PhotosByCompanyEventResponseSchema`.
  - On failure: log structured error and return safe default (`[]`), plus optional notification.
- Add narrow unit tests for parsing happy/sad paths.

Acceptance Criteria
- All services validate responses via Zod.
- On invalid payloads, the app does not crash; friendly errors are logged and surfaced via the notification system (if available).
- Unit tests cover at least one success and one failure case per service.

Guardrails
- Do not change service call signatures yet.
- Do not introduce new UI; focus on correctness and graceful degradation.
