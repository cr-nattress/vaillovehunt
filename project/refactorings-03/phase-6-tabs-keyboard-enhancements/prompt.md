# Phase 6 â€” Tabs Keyboard Enhancements (WAI-ARIA)

Goal
- Finish tab keyboard support and ensure full compliance with WAI-ARIA patterns.

Scope
- In `src/App.jsx`, add:
  - Arrow key navigation between tabs (Left/Right)
  - Home/End to jump to first/last tab
  - Only active tab is tabbable (tabIndex=0) while others are -1
- Ensure `role=tablist`, `role=tab`, `role=tabpanel`, `aria-selected` are correct.

Out of Scope
- Visual changes to tabs.

Implementation Steps
- Add keydown handlers for tabs to cycle focus.
- Update `aria-controls`/`aria-labelledby` wiring as needed.
- Manual test with keyboard-only; confirm focus order is logical.

Acceptance Criteria
- Tabs are fully accessible via keyboard and announce correctly via screen readers.
- No regressions to existing click/touch interactions.
