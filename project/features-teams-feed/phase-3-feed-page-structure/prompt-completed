Phase 3: Feed Page Structure - COMPLETED

✅ Tasks Completed:
1. Created Feed directory structure (src/features/feed/components & types)
2. Defined Feed types (FeedPost, TeamInfo interfaces)
3. Created FeedHeader component with back button and refresh button
4. Created PostCard component with loading skeleton animation
5. Created main FeedPage component with mock data
6. Updated App.jsx to use new FeedPage instead of placeholder
7. Tested Feed page structure and responsiveness

✅ Implementation Details:

**Directory Structure:**
```
src/features/feed/
├── components/
│   ├── FeedPage.tsx
│   ├── PostCard.tsx
│   └── FeedHeader.tsx
└── types/
    └── index.ts
```

**Key Components:**
- **FeedHeader**: Sticky header with back navigation and refresh button
- **PostCard**: Twitter-like post cards with team info, images, captions, reactions
- **PostCardSkeleton**: Animated loading skeleton for smooth UX
- **FeedPage**: Main page component with mock data, loading states, empty states

**Mock Data:**
- 2 sample posts from "Team Rockies" and "Team Alpine"
- Realistic timestamps (2min ago, 15min ago)
- Sample reactions (likes, comments, shares)
- Proper team emojis and location data

**Features Implemented:**
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Loading skeletons with pulse animation
- Empty state handling
- Time formatting ("2m ago", "15m ago", etc.)
- Image error handling with placeholder fallback
- Hover effects on interaction buttons
- Proper accessibility with semantic HTML

✅ Verification Results:

- All TypeScript types properly defined ✅
- Components render correctly with mock data ✅
- Responsive design works on different screen sizes ✅
- Loading states and animations function properly ✅
- Navigation between Hunt and Feed pages works ✅
