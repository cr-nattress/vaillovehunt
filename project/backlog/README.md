# Product Backlog

This folder holds planning artifacts for Epics and User Stories. Over time, active feature folders from `project/` can be moved here under the relevant Epic.

## Structure
- `epics/` — One folder per Epic
  - `README.md` — Problem statement, goals, scope, KPIs
  - `user-stories/` — Individual User Story folders
- `TEMPLATES/` — Reusable templates for epics and user stories

## Workflow
1) Create or pick an Epic under `epics/`.
2) Add User Stories under that Epic’s `user-stories/` directory.
3) Link code work in `project/` phases back to the relevant User Story.
4) When a feature becomes active, you can keep implementation in `project/` and mirror progress here, or migrate the folder once stable.
